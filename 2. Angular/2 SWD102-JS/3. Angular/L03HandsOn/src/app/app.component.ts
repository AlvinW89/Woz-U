I started playing with computers and tryign to fix them when I was 13. I burnt out of IT and now I am here. Being yelled at over the phone by consumers and treating you less then human gets to you after decades of doing consumer support (not all IT). I hav the customer service skills, just rather not deal with them  anymore lol. But will snap in my mode when needed too.';
